A ride sharing simulator that models wait time as a metric of effectiveness of ride allocation

Term Project Author: Dipak Krishnan 

My project is a ride-sharing simulation that aims to visualize how ride-sharing works and emulate a simpler version of the technical aspects that form the bedrock to modern ride-sharing solutions like Uber. I created a grid that is a simpler version of the city grids that Uber engineers use, and animated cars to move users across the grid to their desired destinations. 

The significance of this project lies in the fact that it takes a very real problem in figuring out how to match drivers and passengers in the most optimal way possible, and visualizes how one might solve it, and how optimal solutions compare to random ones. 


3rd Party Libraries: 

MatplotLib: 

1. Open a command prompt window in terminal and go to the folder containing get-pip.py. Then run python get-pip.py in the command line. 

2. Once you have pip3 installed, run pip3 install matplotlib in the command line.  

3. This will install matplotlib in its entirety.

PIL:

1. Assuming you know that pip3 is installed, you can run the command pip3 install Pillow. 

2. This will install Pillow in its entirety. 

Numpy: 


1. Assuming you know that pip3 is installed, you can run the command pip3 install Numpy.

2. This will install Numpy in its entirety.
